# Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Beta Cells in Human Pancreatic Islets

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project reproduces and extends analysis of **single-cell RNA-seq data** 
comparing healthy and Type 2 diabetic pancreatic beta cells.  
It was completed as part of **BINF6310 â€“ Introduction to Computational Methods in Bioinformatics**.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members
- Dinesh Sambhaji Pradhan  
- Asmitha Nagajothi Purushotam  
- Vedant Kulkarni  
- Rich Goodier  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build a reproducible pipeline for scRNA-seq analysis.  
- Compare transcriptomes of beta cells from healthy vs. T2D samples.  
- Identify differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways.

## ðŸ”¬ Methods & Tools
- **QC & Preprocessing:** Cutadapt, FastQC, MultiQC  
- **Alignment & Quantification:** STAR, featureCounts  
- **Analysis:** R (DESeq2, clusterProfiler), Python (pandas, matplotlib), NetworkAnalyst  
- **Pipeline Management:** Nextflow, Conda  

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
- Identified downregulation of *INS* and *PDX1* in T2D beta cells.  
- Revealed heterogeneity within beta cells (RBP4+ subpopulations).  
- GSEA showed enrichment of stress and metabolic pathways.
